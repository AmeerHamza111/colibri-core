PatternModel
    - class encoding version
    - stores patterns? 
    - stores pointers?  If yes, then it also has a corpus included


read  PatternPointerModel as PatternModel: yes
write PatternPointermodel as PatternModel: yes

read PatternModel as PatternPointerModel: no
write PatternModel as PatternPointerModel: no
